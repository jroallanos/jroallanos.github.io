My name is Joaquín A. Roa Llanos, and I am a PhD Researcher at the LIRIS Group, KU Leuven (Brussels, Belgium). I am currently pursuing a PhD in Business Economics at the Faculty of Economics and Business, KU Leuven.

My research focuses on smart agriculture, IoT solutions, and machine learning, with additional interests in machine learning for public policing and strategic management. My doctoral work is supervised by Prof. Dr. Estefanía Serral Asensio and Prof. Dr. Jan Diels.

I hold a Master's degree in Data Science and a Bachelor’s degree in Industrial Engineering from the University of Chile. My joint master’s thesis, 'Machine Learning Tools for Crime Predictions', was supervised by Prof. Dr. Richard Weber and Prof. Dr. Sebastián Maldonado.
