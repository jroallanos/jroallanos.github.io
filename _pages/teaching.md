## teaching assistant

<!-- This role can be subdivided as both 'auxiliary teacher' (*profesor auxiliar*), in which the role consists into teaching students, contributing to organize the syllabus, amongst other tasks. Also, it is listed a different role, which could be translated as assistant (*ayudante*), where the role is to grade evaluations, assist students in course projects, amongst others. Here they are mixed, but roughfly the latter half are almost all 'auxiliary' roles, and the first half, assistant as described. -->

This role can be divided into two distinct positions commonly found in Latin American academic contexts: 'profesor auxiliar' (*auxiliary instructor*) and 'ayudante' (*teaching assistant*).

As an *auxiliary instructor*, responsibilities include delivering lectures, contributing to syllabus design, and supporting the overall coordination of the course. In contrast, the *teaching assistant* role typically involves grading assignments and exams, providing support to students in course projects, and assisting with class logistics.

In the list below, the distinction between the two roles is sometimes blurred. However, roughly speaking, entries in the second half of the list correspond to the 'profesor auxiliar' role, while those in the first half refer more closely to the 'ayudante' role.
